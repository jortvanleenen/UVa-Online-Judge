# UVa-Online-Judge
A select set of answers to various questions on UVa Online Judge made in C++11.

I favoured writing understandable, sometimes longer/more verbose, code in contrast to trying to achieve the shortest program in terms of lines as possible. I did try to keep time complexity to a minimum. I have not explicitly taken memory complexity into account, as it was not a criteria I was judged on (, therefore, I might sometimes favour readability again over memory usage).
