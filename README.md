# UVa-Online-Judge
A select set of answers to various questions on UVa Online Judge made in C++11.

I favoured writing understandable, sometimes longer/more verbose, code compared to trying to achieve the shortest program in terms of lines possible. I kept time complexity to a minimum. I have not explicitly considered memory complexity, as it was not a criterion I was judged on. Therefore, I might again sometimes favour readability over memory usage.

All answers are accepted on Online Judge unless stated otherwise (see the Doxygen at the top of each solution)
